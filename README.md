Internet ping server/client over a UDP network connection

The server sits in an infinite loop listening for incoming UDP packets. When a packet comes in,the server simply sends the encapsulated data back to the client. It simulates packet loss andtransmission delay.

The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine return the data back to the client unchanged.
